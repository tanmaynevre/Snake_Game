# Classic Snake Game (Python + Tkinter)

This is a simple yet engaging **Snake game** built with Python’s built-in `tkinter` library. The project showcases basic game development concepts, including real-time input handling, canvas drawing, and collision logic, all within a lightweight GUI framework.

## Game Features

* **Snake Movement**: Controlled using the arrow keys.
* **Food Mechanics**: Food spawns randomly on the grid; eating it increases the snake's length and score.
* **Collision Detection**: The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
* **Real-Time Gameplay**: Smooth animations use `after()` for frame updates.
* **Score Display**: Shows the live score during gameplay and the final score when the game ends.
